# Project Description  
The project makes use of Random Forest Classifier to make predictions on the titanic dataset. It acheived an accuaracy of 78.7% on final test data for the official  
kaggle contest(with username adishriml).  
# Project Directory  
The project directory consists of the following files:  
1. **train.csv** : The training data available for training the model.
2. **preprocessing.ipynb** : The notebook used for performing preprocessing of data with operations such as imputation, feature extraction and feature scaling.
4. **train_final.csv** : Final training data ready to be trained.
5. **prediction.ipynb** : Notebook file used for training the model on final training data.
6. **model.pkl** : Model file to be used for making predictions. Obtained after extracting the best trained model across epochs while training.
7. **predictions.csv**  : Final predictions for each record of testing data.
